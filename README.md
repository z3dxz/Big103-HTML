A way to extract song information from the radio station **big103** and send it through discord

## Why?

Why not

## How?

Right now this program is only designed for me to use, however, the source code is avalible if anyone wants to adapt it.
The discord webhook URL is hard-coded for now and would need to be changed.

## Dependencies

SFML 2.6.2
Libcurl
